Breakdown by ChatGPT: 

This script is a Python keylogger that logs all keystrokes on a computer and sends them via email using the SMTP protocol. The keylogger runs indefinitely and sends the recorded keystrokes every "SEND_REPORT_EVERY" (60 seconds in this case) seconds to the specified email address using the specified email password. The script uses the "keyboard" library to record keystrokes and the "smtplib" library to send emails. The script also uses the "datetime" library to record the start and end datetime of the keylogger and the "threading" library to set the intervals at which the keylogger sends the keystrokes. It is important to note that creating a keylogger and using it without proper authorization is illegal in many jurisdictions.
